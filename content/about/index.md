# Who Are We?

We are the Hills Road Robotics Group, a group of students at [Hills Road Sixth Form College](https://www.hillsroad.ac.uk/) who run a Robotics Competition, [RoboCon](https://hr-robocon.org/), and compete in [Student Robotics](https://studentrobotics.org/). We have competed in Student Robotics almost every year that it has run since its initial launch, and we were the first team from outside Southampton to participate. However, in 2018 Student Robotics did not run. So we decided to run our own robotics competition instead, and thus RoboCon was born. 

From 2002 to 2011, we competed in entered the [FIRST Robotics Competition](https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/frc/). This is where the team's name, Systemetric, comes from. The metric system of measurement. The words ‘metric’ and ‘system’ were switched around to create the team name ('System-metric'). The name was chosen as a reference to the United States' continued use of the imperial system of measurement, where the UK has changed to the metric system.

# When and where to find us

As we operate as an enrichment, we currently meet during period 4 on Mondays. However, most of our work is also done on Saturdays. If you want to take part, you can find us on the ground floor of the S-block - new members are always welcome! You can also contact us at [robotics@hrsfc.ac.uk](mailto:robotics@hrsfc.ac.uk).

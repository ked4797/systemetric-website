We've been back in college for nearly an entire term now, and a lot has happened. We have welcomed in a new group of lower sixth students to robotics, almost all of whom seem daunted by the chaos, but they'll learn. We've also launched RoboCon 2022 and learnt that Student Robotics is in fact in person this year (which we're very excited about), as well as running a small internal competition to introduce the lower sixth students to our BrainBoxes.  

RoboCon got off to a great start when we launched on the 30th of October, with eight teams attending the launch event and spending the day working on some Halloween-themed tasks using the robot kit. Since then, we've had another thirteen teams join, bringing us up to capacity. This year's competition is called Gifts for the Wizard, and is themed after the Wizard of Oz. Teams have to collect gifts and move them to different areas of the arena like the Yellow Brick Road and the Emerald City, scoring different numbers of points based on which zones they end up in.  

Student Robotics' competition this year is called This Way Up, and consists of an arena full of cans, some the right way up, some the wrong way up. Correctly oriented cans score two more points than wrong way up cans when returned to a team's home zone, and can be identified as the right way up by the nonconductive strip that will run around the bottom of the can. We're looking forward to being able to participate in an in-person SR competition for the first time since 2019, and we have already settled on a theme (cyberpunk/space, by popular vote). There will be ducks. 

Of course, we couldn't tell you about our year so far without mentioning our lower sixth and everything they've done so far. Three teams went head-to-head just before the half term, programming autonomous robots that aimed to be the fastest (or closest, as the case often was) to get a ping pong ball into a box, and everyone got some experience using the BrainBoxes. They've also helped with the RoboCon prep and launch and have been exploring some ideas for Student Robotics.  

That's all from us at the moment, and we can confirm that, as mentioned in the last post, we have found a new teacher to take responsibility for (or at least, be in the vicinity of) our chaos, Arthur Greenwood - though Mr Massey is still a frequent attendee of Saturday meetings.

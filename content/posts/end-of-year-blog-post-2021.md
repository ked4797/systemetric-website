The morning of the 17 July was filled with all our teams making last-minute fixes and testing out their robots on the obstacle course as the final competition approached. This particular Saturday marked the end of this year’s robotics – the culmination of the efforts the lower sixth had put into competing against each other throughout the year. The upper sixth had convened in one of the labs in order to deliberate, and went to great lengths to ensure that no prying Y12s would enter. 

Each team got three chances to run the obstacle course, and were judged and scored based on how far they managed to get and what obstacles they successfully tackled. No robot managed to make it through the whole course, unfortunately, but with the exceptions of the Dysons (whose robot broke) and Breadboard and Butter (who are widely accepted to have ceased to exist), all of them made it to the final and gave it a shot. Out of all of the teams who did manage to make three runs of the course, the Union of Poggige won.

After the competition had been wrapped up, everyone made their way outside for a barbecue, as well as a chance to catch up with the alumni who had turned up, presumably for the free food. All of the robots were displayed for people to admire, along with a variety of badges and stickers created by the upper sixth.

After everyone had eaten, and Aly remembered that it was actually necessary to announce the results at some point, everyone convened in the marquee to find out how they had done. The scores were based not only on the teams’ performance on the obstacle course, but categories that they had been scored on over the year, like PCB design, team theme and confectionery (that was definitely provided without any expectation of addition points). 

The final rankings were: 

* 1st place: Union of Poggige 
* 2nd place: Mediocre at Best 
* 3rd place: Masters of Chaos 
* Aesthetics award: The Dysons 
* Upper sixth choice award: The Really Riotous Rambunctious Robot Radicals 

Each award had badges to accompany them, along with sweets that were provided as prizes (although, in the hot weather, the chocolate was rather molten by the time it came to awards presentation).  

After the awards came the gifts that had been bought for Will and Mr Massey as thanks for their support. This year was Mr Massey’s last before retiring, after running robotics for about twenty years. Aly had collated words of thanks and quotes from current and past students to put together on a decorative PCB to present to him. For Will, the upper sixth had created a T-shirt, which was given to him after Mr Massey received his printed circuit board.

That sums up everything we’ve done this year for robotics at Hills. We’ll be back at it again next year though, with a new teacher to take responsibility for our chaos and hopefully, we’ll be running RoboCon 2022 and competing in Student Robotics again.

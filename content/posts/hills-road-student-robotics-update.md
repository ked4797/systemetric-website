Ever since the October Student Robotics kickoff, the Hills Road robotics team has been hard at work building our robot. But we haven't shared much of it! So we thought it was time to show some of our work off but don't expect any of our top secret strategies!

The team is thrilled that we can now pick up cubes (and put them down) with our arm mechanism. We've used a drawer runner, a linear actuator, belt with 3D printed pulleys and a pneumatic pump to construct it.

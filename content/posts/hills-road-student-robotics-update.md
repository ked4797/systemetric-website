Ever since the October Student Robotics kickoff, the Hills Road Robotics Team has been hard at work building our robot, but we haven't shared much of it! So we thought it was time to show off some of our work but don't expect any of our top secret strategies!

The team is thrilled that we can now pick up cubes (and put them down) with our arm mechanism. We've used a drawer runner, a linear actuator, belt with 3D printed pulleys and a pneumatic pump to construct it. It took a lot of time but we think it was worth it!

We have also constructed the support for our arm - which will hold it up in the robot - and we mounted this to the base of the robot. Additionally we mounted motors to the base, which are ready for our wheels and their custom 3D printed axles.

The software side of our team have been working tirelessly to get the robot moving (and in the direction we want!). The test bed has been put to good use, moving up and down the corridor! To improve our robots vision they also changed the Student Robotics vision code to allow us to use different cameras with our robot. We are now working on integrating our game strategy into the code.

Finally we have decided on our fantastic theme for this years competition "A game of two colours". We can't say much about it at the moment, but we can tell you that it involves a printer chassis for our robot and spray painting Nerf guns black. We'll let you keep guessing, but keep your eyes peeled to find out...

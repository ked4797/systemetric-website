Ever since the October Student Robotics kickoff, the Hills Road robotics team has been hard at work building our robot. But we haven't shared much of it! So we thought it was time to show some of our work off but don't expect any of our top secret strategies!

The team is thrilled that we can now pick up cubes (and put them down) with our arm mechanism. We've used a drawer runner, a linear actuator, belt with 3D printed pulleys and a pneumatic pump to construct it.

We have also constructed the support for our arm which will hold it up in the robot. We have already mounted this to the base of the robot. We have also mounted motors to the base, which are ready for our wheels and their custom 3D printed axles.

The software side of our team have been working tirelessly to get the robot moving (and in the direction we want!). They've also modified the Student Robotics vision code to allow us to use different cameras with our robot.

We also have an amazing plan for our theme. We can't say much about it at the moment, but we can tell you that it involves a printer chassis for our robot and spray painting Nerf guns black. We'll let you keep guessing, but keep your eyes peeled to find out...

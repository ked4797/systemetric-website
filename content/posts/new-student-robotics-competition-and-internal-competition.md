It's been almost a year since we last shared what we were up to, but despite the current situation, we’ve still got lots going on.  

Firstly, student robotics is online this year. Each team programs a robot that will compete in a simulator against other robots. Although this means we won't be able to do any hardware stuff, we’re all still really enjoying it.  

If you are interested in the format for this year here is the link to the rulebook: <https://studentrobotics.org/docs/resources/2021/rulebook.html> 

This year, instead of just a final competition at the end of the year, there are 4 league sessions between Christmas and Easter. Teams compete against each other to gain league points which will determine who wins if there is a draw in the final. 

We have also entered 4 teams (HRS1, HRS2, HRS3, HRS4) who all worked hard over the Christmas break to upload the code for the first league session. This was a massive success. HRS3 came in first winning all of their matches and leading with a staggering 82 league points. What's better is the next 3 teams were all the other Hills road teams.

After each league session, the rules change slightly. This meant many of our teams had to completely rewrite their code in the 2-week gap before the next league session. This was quite stressful but worth it, as the top 3 slots on the leader board are currently all Hills teams. 

All 4 teams are currently making changes to their code to keep up with new rules released after League session 2 and to get ready for the next league session.

As well as the student robotics competition, we have also been developing our robotics and electronics skills with an internal competition.  The lower sixth have been split into seven teams, who are all currently designing robots. Their aim is to eventually have the robots compete autonomously to defeat various obstacles and challenges. 

We first started by meeting on the October half term and working together to get various sensors working with the ESP32 dev board. This was really fun and a great opportunity for all the lower sixth to meet the upper sixth and get to know each other.

We then started designing obstacles that the robots would have to overcome before pitching them to everyone. We learnt a lot doing this from CAD to presenting skills. 

“I really enjoyed the whole process of first coming up with an idea, then developing it and drawing out the dimensions before finally presenting it and getting feedback from the group” 

 Some examples below:

Due to the second lockdown, it was decided that we would not be able to make these as we could not meet in person so instead Will, will design and make a series of obstacles based on these ones we designed. Our robots will then compete against these in the summer. 

The chassis for all the robots will be custom designed PCBs (printed circuit boards like the ones you find inside your phones) which we will mount everything to so each team designed a schematic after learning the basics of KiCad (software). This entailed quite a steep learning curve but especially useful to understand. Here is an example schematic:

(We all have our own logos) 

The next step is going to be to layout the PCB (Printed circuit boards). We will have to first place all the different components then layout copper traces to connect all of them.  

We will keep you posted on this blog.

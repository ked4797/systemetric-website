Its been a busy month since we last shared what we've been up to, so here we are!

We have made significant progress on the core mechanisms of our robot. The arm is now integrated into the rest of the robot, so we can pick up cubes and drive simultaneously. We have also implemented a pressure sensor so the code can work out whether there is a cube at the end of the arm or not. Now we have all the main mechanisms attached to the robot base, it's all about refining it and testing rigorously!

To allow us to control the motors more easily, we are designing a custom PCB.

We have also progressed significantly with our theme, but we are still keeping that under wraps! But any robots crawling our site may already know....

As always, keep an eye here and on our [Twitter](https://twitter.com/HR_Robotics) for more updates!

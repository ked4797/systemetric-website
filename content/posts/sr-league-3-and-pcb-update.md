Last Saturday, we had the Student Robotics league 3 and after 36 matches, team HRS4 won all of their matches and overtook HRS1 and HRS3 to take top place on the leader board. It was also a good day for HRS2, who won 3 of their matches and rose to 5th.

HRS1 came up with a controversial new strategy and exploited this to\[CJ1] win 3 of their matches and draw one. They sprinted towards the centre and booby-trapped 2 of the towers on the opponent’s side meaning as soon they tried to claim them, they would lock. This meant that the opponent could only claim a maximum of 5 towers and HRS1 could claim 6.

After the matches had finished, SR announced a dramatic new arena shown below that teams will compete in on the final league and the competition. This arena is much bigger than the last one and now has different towers that are worth up to 8 points, with the gold tower having the highest value.

For our internal competition, we’ve been designing printed circuit boards (PCBs) from the circuit diagrams we made in KiCad. There have been some very impressive PCB art and shapes created by the teams, and the PCBs have now been sent off to be produced. We’re hoping to get them back by the Easter holidays, when we can finally all meet up again.
The lower sixth members of the robotics group got a chance to meet in person last Wednesday for the first time since October, now that they have returned to college and government regulations permit it. They spent over an hour working on their PCBs with the help of Will and were introduced to the obstacle course that he is making for their robots, involving a bridge, a bright light and a bicycle wheel.

The upper sixth have been scoring each of the tasks that the lower sixth have been set so far: creating circuit diagrams, designing PCBs and producing obstacle plans, to name but a few. They announced the scores as they stand in today’s meeting:

A few of the notable PCB designs produced were Union of Poggige’s porridge-shaped PCB(Top left) and Breadboard and Butter’s bread-shaped PCB(Top right). The newly formed Masters of Chaos (made from the remaining members of Team Mannschaft Komanda and Autonomous) has added Iron Man to their board and BB8 to their other board, which is going to make irritating noises and play AC/DC (Second row). 

The Dysons have a round PCB, and plans for a creatively designed chassis, while Mediocre at Best(3rd row on the right) and the Really Riotous Rambunctious Robot Radicals (Bottom left) have gone for the classic square PCB. 

Union of Poggige also has a second PCB (Bottom right), another tried and true square, but they have plans to add a radar-like system using a servo motor and a time of flight sensor.

We’ll have more to update you on after the Easter break, and perhaps even some robots with wheels attached!

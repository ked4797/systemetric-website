On Saturday 26th October 2019, the Hills Road robotics club attended the Student Robotics 2020 Cambridge kickoff. We started the day with an overview of the competition, the rules and the prizes. We were also handed our kit boxes so we could look at the electronics we had to work with. We are excited to be a part of designing, building, and programming robots with help from volunteers from the University of Southampton. On the day, we split up into specialised teams to work on specific bits of the robot, such as design and tactics, hardware programming, simulating code and managing social media. There was a lot of brainstorming and ideas from everyone as we are looking forward to getting started on our robot. Furthermore, we also had minigames and tasks to complete to get familiar with the tools and equipment we will be using over the next 6 months, as well as to compete with the other schools attending.

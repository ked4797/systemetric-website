            and we
            were the first team from outside Southampton to participate. However in 2018 Student Robotics did not run.
            So we
            decided to run our own robotics competition instead, and thus RoboCon was born. In 2019 the robotics group
            is
            running <a href="/blog/announcement-robocon-2019.html" class="">RoboCon for students in year 9-11</a>.</p>
        <p>From 2002-2011 the robotics group entered the <a href="https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/frc/"

            words ‘metric’ and ‘system’ were switched around to create the team name ('System-metric'). The name was
            chosen
            as reference to the United States continued use of the imperial system of measurement, where the UK has
            changed
            to the metric system.</p>

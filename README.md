# systemetric-website

The website for the Hills Road Robotics Team. It explains who we are and showcases our work as 
well as providing a platform for that we can use to share our work (such as the robot revital software).
It is not intened to be used by the competitors of RoboCon as that is an event that we Systemetric run, but
is not all the we Systemetric do.
